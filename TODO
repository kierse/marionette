- remove all code and any referencs to startupScript
- pipe all error messages from system calls to /dev/null like so:
- finish error handler

   /sbin/iwconfig 2> /dev/null

   this will allow me to capture data sent to stdout and hide any data sent to stderr

- create logos
- create a splash screen to be displayed on startup
- look into licensing
- look into autoconf, perl installation scripts, etc
- look at using /sbin/dhclient instead of /sbin/dhcpcd

Questions:
----------

In the model, should getAvailableAPs() return a hash of MAC address
and essid?  I think an array of available essid's would be fine. 
The only case where this may not work is if you have multiple APs
with the same essid that aren't part of the same network.

FIX:
----------
- should only perform basic data gathering from iwlist.  Only need 
just enough to try and connect to ap, no more.  Once connected, I 
can do a detailed scan on access point and get detailed info
